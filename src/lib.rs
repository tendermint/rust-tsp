//! # Tendermint ABCI library for Rust
//!
//! This library provides an application Trait and TCP server for implementing Tendemint ABCI
//! application in Rust.  The Application Trait provides default implementations for each callback
//! to simplify development.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Here's a simple example that communicates with Tendermint. Defaults callbacks are handled by
//! the Trait.  The app doesn't do any actual processing on a transaction.
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! struct EmptyApp;
//!
//! impl abci::Application for EmptyApp {}
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     abci::run_local(EmptyApp);
//! }
//!```
//!
